### Synopsis

A header containing the basic types of the lisp/s-expression library which a few
of the other modules depend on.

### Files

* type.h

## Rationale

The basic C types for the interpreter need defining somewhere! They are shared
across the garbage collector, the S-expression parser and the expression
evaluator.
