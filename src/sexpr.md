### Synopsis

Parses an input stream into an s-expression

### Files

## Rationale

While this S-expression parser was designed to be part of a lisp interpreter it
is also meant to be able to act as a standalone parser for reading and writing
out S-expressions for configuration files and data. Its design has been driven
by this concern so it is not as simple nor tightly bound to the expression
evaluator as it could be were this not so.
