## Synopsis 

A very simple stop-the-world precise garbage collector for a s-expression and
lisp library which depend on it.

## Files

* gc.c
* gc.h

## Rationale

A lisp interpreter would not be complete without a way to automatically collect
garbage and a precise stop-the-world garbage collector is the simplest one to
implement. Efficiency is not the primary concern.
