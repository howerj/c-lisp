A to-do list and scratch pad for this lisp implementation.

### Priority To-Do section

This is the priority to-do list, in order, these things are holding back the
future development of the project.

1. Rewrite internals to use cons cells.

The internals as of 2014-09-17 are based around resizeable arrays which is both
not very efficient and does not reflect the structure of how the lisp
interpreter should be. This is the number one priority and in doing this a lot
of code can be changed to be more elegant, for example instead of a nil object,
NULL can replace it in the cons cell. It makes loops operating over the cons
lists easier to program.

2. Tail Call optimization

Tail call optimization is a must, it is pretty much expected even, it can
implemented quite simply by putting more of the interpreter into **eval**;

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call>

3. Macros

A way of extending lisp from within lisp, proper macros, would be a goal. It
would not be complete without it. This topic will need to be researched
beforehand.

4. Bignums

Arbitrary precision arithmetic is a must, with rational types instead of floats
serving for all mathematical operations.

A library has been added but a few things need to be changed, it is terribly
inefficient on so many fronts -- but it's simple! This needs to be incorporated
and optimized for performance (mainly fewer allocations and frees).

5. Improve performance.

Some of the ways the system is designed will be inherently slow even if it was
easy to do that way; I/O and memory allocation spring to mind. I/O should not be
done *one byte at a time* where possible. There are far too many memory
allocations.

6. Suppress return value of library function definitions 

This is in the running interpreter. It is just annoying seeing them defined 
all the time.

7. Linenoise

The Linenoise library needs to be split up and reorganized. UTF-8 and Windows
support would also be good.

8. Calls to exit()

Being that this is primarily meant to be a library it should handle
Out-Of-Memory and other conditions more gracefully, instead of giving up and
calling exit(), which is the wrong thing to do.

The assert()s that call abort() are a different matter however.

9. Primop API

The internal API for primitive operations if fairly simple, each function
accepts an expression argument lisp and a pointer to the lisp environment it is
running in. This could be made simpler by making the later one of the possible
forms it can take, such a nil, tee, an integer, a list, and now a pointer to the
lisp environment it runs it. 

A partial reason for this is that it would make the internal API simpler, you
would not have to worry about it as a programmer unless you needed to, and
secondly it would allow more powerful manipulations of the environment from
within it.

### Bugs

1. Garbage collection

I am not sure how effective my garbage collector is, it might not be working
correctly. To test it I should run the interpreter with Valgrind and "massif" to
get an overview what is getting freed when, initial testing did not prove to go
very well. 

2. Funarg problem and evaluation.

The funarg problem is not solved correctly leading to incorrect code! Also
somethings are not evaluated at the right time.

3. Overflow is not dealt with.

It is possible to deal with it in the code, but a compiler flag option
would be the quickest, even it is not portable. GCC supports the *-trapv* 
flag which could be used but it only works for signed overflow.

4. There is no maximum recursion depth.

As such a valid lisp program can trash the stack. This is not a good thing.

5. ((lambda (x) (+ x 2)) 4) does not work.

You can't do this at the moment, you should be able to.

### A more general To-Do section.

This is a more general to-do section, it might as well be treated as a "this
might be nice to have section" and it might duplicate that priority section in
its items.


* Orient the lisp towards processing text Ã  la mode de awk/sed/tr 
  - Perhaps these could be implemented as a macro package?

* Make a library out of the grep/tr/sed/ed routines for inclusion elsewhere.
 
* Bignum should round towards zero and not negative infinity.

* Look into pattern matching on full S-expressions and replacing, set operations
  on S-expressions as well.

* Add a maximum recursion depth in Eval which there is not at the moment.
  This makes a stack overflow possible currently.

* Add errno handling in a portable way.

* Rethink parser, perhaps special routines for escaping and un-escaping
  strings, for dealing with buffers that could have NULL in them.

* Time/Date functions

* The parser should:
  - Handle arbitrary precision numbers
  - Handle arbitrary length strings

* Signal handling plan:
  - Set up signals handlers for each standard C signals that sets global value
  to signal number.
  - Register variables with signal handler names and value of that handler
  - Check if signal global variable is zero or not, if not zero, set to zero
  and lookup handler for signal. This should be done in Eval.
  - The signal handler can be an arbitrary lisp expression

* Write specifications for each of the modules. 

This along with Unit tests would *help* in rooting out bugs and *help*
making the project more formal. Some modules should be easier
than others like the "regex" modules, "eval" within the lisp
interpreter and the "bignum" module (when complete).

For each ".c" file and any lonely ".h" files there should be a specification
as at the moment each c file represents a single 'unit' that needs
specifying. The specification should probably be written in markdown and
converted to whatever format needed (such as man-pages or HTML). The
source folder would look like this:

file\_1.c
file\_1.h
file\_1.md
file\_2.c
file\_2.h
file\_2.md
...
file\_N.c
file\_N.h
file\_N.md

The sub directories with experiment branches should be removed and the
test bench / unit tests moved to a folder in the top level directory.

<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html>

* Rethink special forms;
  - Use "cond" instead of (or in addition to) "if".
  - Add "loop"

* Tail call optimization;
  This is a must, tail call optimization can be achieved by moving some
  primitives into eval

* I should be able to implement a metacircular interpreter like the
  one from <https://sep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/jmc.lisp>.

* Lisp bug; ./lisp -e 'Erroneous\_Input'
  This should fail not silently do nothing.

* I should check memcpy arguments, as well as other library calls
  - Check realloc, string library functions, etc.

* Special parsing of if,begin,... etc. Best way to deal with this?

* Makefiles; I should simplify the build process.
  - Make makefiles simpler.
  - Make them portable to other make utilities, not just GNU make.

* Support UTF-8
  UTF-8 is not supported and I do not know of the best way to support
  it yet.

* Better debugging information. Printing allocated/freed memory locations
  would not go amiss.

* Move primops to a separate file

* Unit Tests / Test benches
  Writing unit tests / test benches would really help in moving the code
  to use different data structures, it would help in incrementally moving
  it from one to the other.

* Handle EOF on output
* Check everything for *consistency*
* Implement all basic primitive ops
* Put all primops in a separate C-file
* Macros with return in them should be removed

* Check for return values on all functions that can fail!
* Better error handling; a new primitive type should be made
  for it, one that can be caught.
* Make the special forms less special!

### The Interpreter

While the core interpreter should be written in C, and therefore compile with 
a conforming compiler, the demonstration application can be made OS specific,
requiring for example a POSIX API to work.

Examples of libraries and APIs I could implement functionality from:
  - dlopen wrapper to load dynamic library plug-ins
  - line editor library 
  - socket library (plug-in)
  - OpenGL interface (plug in)

And other behavior:
  - Have a "home" directory and configuration file.
  - Install a standard lisp library somewhere.

### Hash lib

* 'delete' in hash implementation, rework the hash library
* Should use void\* (and sexpr\_t for the special case of this program)
