This is version one of the interpreter, as such it will probably be thrown away
and completely rewritten.

I should rewrite all the data structures to avoid the use of void \* and instead
use unions off all the values I want.

Data structures/types:
  * Hash Table
  * Tries
  * Memory
  * Int, Primitive, list/cons, String, File handle, Hash

This lisp should be specialized for text handling and running system commands,
much like perl, with built in regex syntax and handling.
