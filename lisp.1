.SH NAME
lisp \- A small lisp interpreter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
lisp (-[hcpE])* (-e string)? (-o file)? file* -
.SH DESCRIPTION
A small and extensible lisp interpreter, written in C, implemented as a library
with a thin wrapper.
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B -h
Print out the usage string and exit successfully.

.TP
.B -c
Turn on colorization of printed out S-Expressions, it assumes your terminal can
handle ANSI color codes. If it cannot do not select this option. It does no
checking for whether it is writing to terminal or not with isatty(3).

.TP
.B -p
This will turn the prompt on, by default no prompt is given when typing so as
to allow output to be piped to other programs following the "No news is good
news" Unix maxim.

.TP
.B -E
This will turn on the line editor when reading from stdin.

.TP
.B -e string
Evaluate a string as input, this disables reading from stdin(3).

.TP
.B -o file
Open "file" and redirect output to it.

.TP
.B file
An argument that is not preceded by a valid option that takes an argument is 
treated as a file to be read from. Reading from a single file disables reading
from stdin(3).

.TP
.B -
This forces reading from stdin(3). By default the interpreter will read from
stdin(3) but this behavior is disabled if an argument has been evaluated with
"-e" or a file has been read in.

.TP
If no file is given the interpreter reads input from stdin(3), if one is given
then the interpreter will exit after having read all input files or evaluated
all strings.

Arguments are read in order and executed as soon as they are encountered.

.SH SEE ALSO
liblisp(3)
.SH BUGS
There are bound to be many in the interpreter library, comments on known ones
are in the source code. 

Files that begin with "-" cannot be read from, they are instead treated as
options and will most likely be invalid options.

If an error is encountered in a file it will continue to process the remaining
input and then continue on to any other files passed in onto the command line
instead of exiting.
