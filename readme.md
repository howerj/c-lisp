Lisp Interpreter; an experimental (in the sense of personal learning) lisp
interpreter with minimal system dependencies to aide in portability.

### plan

Create lisp interpreter in stages:

1. Make parse with I/O and memory libraries.
  * I/O system can perform arbitrary redirection
  * Detailed error reporting
  * Safe memory allocation and garbage collection
2. Test parsing. 
3. Experimental lisp development phase.
4. Eval.
5. Extend interpreter.
6. Extend interpreter in lisp.

## TODO

* Improve makefile
* Getopts
* Eval
